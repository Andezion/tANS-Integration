## General info  
First, let's take a look at what tANS is and why it is important to be able to integrate it!
tANS (Tabled Asymmetric Numeral Systems) is a modern entropy compression method that combines the efficiency of arithmetic coding with the simplicity of Huffman implementation. It allows for high compression ratios with minimal computational and memory overhead, making it particularly valuable for embedded systems and IoT devices.

The integration of tANS into Contiki-NG, an operating system for the Internet of Things, opens up the possibility of reducing the amount of data transmitted over wireless channels and lowering energy consumption. This is critically important in the context of limited sensor node resources, where every byte transmitted and every processor cycle counts.

## Final result  
As a result of this work, the tANS algorithm was integrated into the Contiki-NG operating system!

To begin with, on the local device, I managed to build a single process that combines: initialisation of the encoder and decoder based on a given alphabet with different symbol frequencies, compression of string messages into a compact bit representation, transmission of received packets via UDP between nodes (in the test â€” to itself), successful decoding of messages on the receiving side.
Experimental measurements showed that the compression ratio was ~0.6, which confirms the effectiveness of the tANS method in conditions of limited resources. Thus, the possibility of using tANS to reduce network traffic and energy consumption in Contiki-NG-based IoT scenarios has been proven.
